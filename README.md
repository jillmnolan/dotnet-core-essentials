# README


## Introduction

The premise of the **.NET Core Essentials** is to allow the .NET Core developer to have all the essential plugins at their disposal to extend the features and functionality of VSCode with the convenience of a **one-click installation** process.  The ultimate goal for this extension pack is: **convenience**.  After all, the main inspiration is to help .NET developers and the vocational teachers at my place of employment to have a one-stop place for all the necessary extension.

* **Please be advised that this is an "off-the-clock" passion side project. :-)**

* **Please be advised that the README file will be reformatted and better descriptions inserted in the near future. Cheers!**

* **Please do not hesitate to make suggestions on how to improve this extension pack in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jillmnolan/dotnet-core-essentials/issues).  Your feedback and suggestions are appreciated immensely.**
